The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can cause issues if there are spaces between the operators and operands, or if there are invalid operators or units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` is valid, but `width: calc( 100% - 10px )` is invalid (because of spaces around the minus operator).  Another common mistake is using incompatible units. For example, `width: calc(100px + 5em)` is valid, but `width: calc(100px + 5%)` will likely not produce the expected results.
